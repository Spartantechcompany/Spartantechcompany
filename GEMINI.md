# Workspace Vision: The Agent-Driven Terminal

This directory is the central workspace for a revolutionary experiment: leveraging the Gemini CLI as a core engine to create an intelligent, agent-driven terminal environment.

The goal is to explore the full potential of a terminal enhanced by AI, integrating a suite of modern development, networking, and AI tools.

# Key Technologies & Integrations

This workspace will focus on the interaction and orchestration of the following tools through `gemini-cli`:

*   **Core Engine:** Gemini CLI
*   **Containerization:** Docker Desktop
*   **Automation:** n8n
*   **Networking & Security:** Cloudflare, Twingate, Tailscale
*   **AI & Language Models:** Claude, Codex

# Usage & Goals

This space will be used for:

*   Learning and mastering the `gemini-cli`.
*   Developing scripts and workflows that connect Gemini with the tools listed above.
*   Experimenting with AI agents to automate complex tasks directly from the command line.
*   Pushing the boundaries of what a terminal can be.
